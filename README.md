# Snake.py üêç

A simple and fun snake game made with Python and the turtle module.

## How to play

- Use the arrow keys to move the snake around the screen.
- Eat the blue circles (food) to grow longer and increase your score.
- Avoid hitting the walls or your own tail, or you will lose the game.
- Try to beat your own high score every time you play.

## How it works

The game consists of four python files:

- main.py: The main script that runs the game loop and handles the user input and screen updates.
- snake.py: The module that defines the Snake class and its methods to create, move and control the snake.
- food.py: The module that defines the Food class and its methods to create and refresh the food at random locations on the screen.
- scoreboard.py: The module that defines the Scoreboard class and its methods to display, update and increase the score, as well as to show the game over message.

The game uses the turtle module to create and manipulate the graphics on the screen. The turtle module is a built-in Python library that provides a simple way to draw shapes and animations using a virtual turtle.
